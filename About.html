        <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>Just as every masterpiece begins with a crafter’s supplies, NishLeather’s world-class company was built from small beginnings. Founded as a shoe shop in 1973 by Ryuichi Nishimura, NishLeather would eventually grow to become an elite manufacturer of quality leather and nylon products and distributor of supplies for harnessmakers, saddlemakers and a wide range of other craftspeople.
          <br>
          <br>
          
          While the original shoe shop’s primary focus was shoe repair, Ryuichi saw opportunities to expand the business into other markets. The company began manufacturing leather horse halters, which opened the door to sell to area harness and tack shops. 
          <br>
          <br>
          
          In 1983, the company began distributing leather and hardware under the Nish Distributing Co. name in response to a growing demand among its customers for raw materials, and the supply division was born. The following year  NishLeather Goods and Nish Distributing Co. merged to form NishLeather, and the company’s first consignment auction was held. Known as a must-attend event, this annual auction is still bringing people from across the country together today to buy and sell a wide range of machinery, tools, and leather.
          <br>
          <br>
          As the supply division grew, NishLeather produced its first 36-page supply catalog featuring leather, hardware, tools and supplies in 1990. The world-class company now offers one of the best product selections in the business. With leather, hardware, tools, leather care, equipment, sewing machines and more, NishLeather is the supplier of choice for both professionals and hobbyists. As a supplier with manufacturing experience, NishLeather knows that having the right supplies is essential to the success of any project.
          <br>
          <br>
